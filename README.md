Linear regression model to predict the profit of 50 startups

Using the attached dataset, write linear regression model to predict the profit of 50
startups.

What you need to do here is:

1- Submit the complete python code (Jupyter Nootbook).

2- Use 40 instances for training and 10 for testing

3- Write a report about your experiments:

a. What alpha value did you used? And why. If you selected the value using experiments testing, show your results with alpha values you have tested.

b. How many iterations did you use? And why? Show results of experiment testing. (e.g., what was the cost function at iteration 100, 500, 1000 and so
on).

c. Report your tuned alpha values.

d. Report the best cost function you have reached after tuning alpha values.

e. Use the test dataset (10 instances) and predict their profits using the updated alpha values.

f. Create a table with real values vs predicted values (for 10 instances).

g. Plot the real values and the predicted values. Use different color for each.

h. For testing: predict all 50 instances and compare them with the real values

(plot them as in g).
